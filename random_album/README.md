Add a random album from your entire music collection (not from the current playlist).

There's a variation, that writes a history file and used that file to avoid adding the same albums over and over again.

As an exercise left to the reader, there's much room for optimization. Works fast enough on my machineâ„¢, but pull requests welcome.
